#Notes for CS260
##Homework 1
First time merging conflicts, so I figured out how that works. Fiddled a bit with git some more. 

##ec2
Setup server. public ip address is 35.153.96.24
ssh command:
ssh -i [pem file] ubuntu@35.153.96.24
May need to upgrade server eventually

##html: Structure
Fiddled with html. More familiar with img, a, etc now.
