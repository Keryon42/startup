#Notes for CS260
##Homework 1
First time merging conflicts, so I figured out how that works. Fiddled a bit with git some more. 

##ec2
Setup server. public ip address is 35.153.96.24
ssh command:
ssh -i [pem file] ubuntu@35.153.96.24
May need to upgrade server eventually

##https
Route 53 faied to acquire the domain name I requested, offered no reason why, and after I submitted a ticket got that domain name no issue. Work further ahead in the future.

##html: Structure
Fiddled with html. More familiar with img, a, etc now. 

##CSS: Flex
CSS is kind of a pain. Hard to find the most up to date method of doing something, took a lot of experimentation to figure some things out. 

##CSS: Deliverable
CSS is a pain. I found some solutions for displaying text one character at a time, but nothing really works the way I want with just CSS, so come back to it with Javascript. 

##JS: Objects and Classes
Object oriented stuff feels familiar. Syntax is kinda weird for Javascript, and weak typing makes me unhappy, but I'm starting to get a feel.
